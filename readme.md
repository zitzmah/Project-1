## Description on Project

A paragraph discussing the idea of your project, the API you are using and desired user experience.

> I am creating a perfume maker, we generate list of perfume ingredient using the items from the perfume ingredient api. Users will select ingredients and generate an imaginary perfume.

## Details about the API

Give me a brief description of the API you are using and how you plan on using it. Does it use some sort of authentication like an APIkey. List some of the urls are using below.

- `https://www.perfumeapi.com/ingredients`: This returns a json array with all the different ingedients

Sample Fetch/Ajax called:
```js
const url = "https://www.perfumeapi.com/ingredients"
fetch(url)
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => console.log(data))
```

The Data I get back:
```json
[
  {
    "ingredient": "Bergamot",
    "description": "A citrus fruit with a bright, uplifting scent."

  {
    "ingredient": "Lavender",
